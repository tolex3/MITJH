# MITJH

To be able to collaborate on code/text etc, I suggest each of you create a fresh
directory, (which is currently not under Git!) on you local machine.

Once that new directory is created, go to that directory ($cd MyNewDir) and run the below code to initialize git and to connect to the Github MITJH repo.
